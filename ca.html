The Common Application

<div class = "commonApp">
<p>		


What is the Common Application?

<br></br>

The Common App is an online college application that is used by over 500 colleges. It is a one
				
step application that will help you to apply to almost all of the schools on your list.
	<br></br>				
The Common App is broken down into many different parts. Here are just a few: Your Individual Profile, Family Information, Education Information, Test Scores, Extracurricular Activities, and Writing Samples.
	<br></br>				
Now at first this list can seem very daunting and long-How are you going to know all of this information?! But do not worry! Try setting a schedule or some time in your day to fill it out with a parent or a guidance counselor if you need help. Before you know it all of that information will be done before you know it!
		<br></br>			
That does not mean that your job for the summer when it comes to the Common App is done. There are two things you need to have before entering your senior year in order to complete the Common App.
					
		<br></br>				 							
You need to have your guidance counselor's email to write a letter of recommendation for you! 
						
					 				
	<br></br>		
		
		 	 	 		
	
					 							
You also need at least two teachers that you are going to ask to write a letter of recommendation for you! 
						
	<br></br>				 				
			
		
		 	 		
			
				


<div class = "tips">	
	<ul>
	<p>		
	<div id="so">
	So...how do you get a recommendation?	
	
	</div>
<li> It does not hurt to ask or even mention it to your teachers that you are planning on asking for a recommendation in the following school year before summer starts. At least you get your foot in the water and they are not 
completely bombarded with you asking for a recommendation in the fall. The teachers who you should ask are teachers who you know will give you a good recommendation and who know you well. Try asking a teacher who has 
seen you make progress in their class. Another thing you should  BE POLITE! Being nice goes a long way. </li>
				


				
<li>Provide teachers with a resume of your accomplishments and any activities that you have done. This will help add to your recommendation and make it better than ever since it will show how great of a student you have been throughout high school!</li>

 				

				
<li> If you are using the Common App, the teachers who are going to recommend you need to have access to be invited to that page. To do that you will need their email. Also it does not hurt to stop by and ask your teacher how your recommendation is going .It shows that you are keeping up with your priorities.</li>


					
		
<li> Beware of Deadlines! Deadlines are like monsters sleeping under your bed. Make sure that you are aware of dates especially if you are applying early action or early decision. Let your recommender(s) now this date also so that you can receive your recommendation on time. 
Make sure to let them know when you tell them and do not remind them last minute. Teachers are busy and can forget sometimes so make sure you do not forget yourself. </li>
								
		
<li>When all of the stress is over and you have submitted your application with your recommendation. Do not forget to thank your teacher(s). It is simply a nice way to show your appreciation for them taking time out of their schedule to do something for you.</li></p>

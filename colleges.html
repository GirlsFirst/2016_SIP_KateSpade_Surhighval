<h2> <a href="https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/find-colleges/how-to-find-your-college-fit/college-search-step-by-step "> College Search Step-by-Step</a> </h2>
<p> Although there's no magic formula for choosing a college, you can start by asking yourself some questions that help most students find the right fit.  </p>

At College Confidential, we have assembled an editorial team to bring our visitors the best college admissions content on the Web. </p>

<h2> <a href=" https://www.unigo.com/college-match "> Get Matched to Colleges </a> </h2>

<h2> <a href="http://www.collegeaffordabilityguide.org/">
Find the most affordable colleges & degrees in the USA</a> </h2>
<p>It's no secret that the cost of college has risen dramatically over the past ten years. At the same time, the job market has been very difficult for most people. The goal of our site is to provide information that will help prospective students find and complete degrees that might actually move their careers forward.

In a way, all the information they might need is already out there. It's just spread out across a number of different locations: the federal government's many web sites; the web sites of independent organizations like the College Board (check out their BigFuture site, by the way - it's an incredible resource) or accrediting agencies; and the web sites of the colleges themselves.

If prospective students had infinite time on their hands, they'd be able to visit all those sites and gather the data they're looking for. But since infinite time is hard to come by, we believe that there's a role for us to play. </p>

<h6>WHAT IS THE FAFSA?</h6>
<br></br>
<div class="big">


The Free Application for Federal Student Aid is the ticket to federal money for college 
and many other types of scholarships as well. There are plenty of options out there to help
you pay for college, you should be aware of all of them!The FAFSA, officially known as the
Free Application for Federal Student Aid, is the form that families fill out to apply for
federal grants, loans, and work-study funds for college students. It is administered by 
the U.S. Department of Education, which provides more than $150 billion in student aid 
each year.Your eligibility for federal grants (which don't have to be repaid) and fede
ral loans (which do) will generally be based on your financial need, as determined by the info
rmation you supply on your FAFSA. You can get a preview of whether the FAFSA is likely to 
qualify you for federal grants by using the "FAFSA4caster" on the Department of Education
website.Even if the FAFSA4caster indicates that your family's income and assets put you 
out of the range for grants, it's still worth going ahead and completing the FAFSA. That's 
because most colleges, state scholarship agencies, and foundations use the FAFSA in deciding
who gets their scholarship money,as well as how much each student will receive. Also, filing
a FAFSA automatically qualifies you for low-cost federal student loans of at least $5,500 a
year.You can find out more about the FAFSA, including the deadlines for completing it, at

<h6>FAFSA/FINACIAL AID VOCABULARY</h6>
<br></br>
</body>
<div class="vocab">
<br>

<h4>Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA):</h4> 
Filling out a FAFSA form is the first step in the financial aid process. To be eligible to receive federal financial aid, a student must complete a FAFSA.
					
<h4>Cost of Attendance (COA):</h4>
 This is the total cost of attending a college or university, including tuition, room and board, books, lab fees, transportation and basic living expenses.
					
<h4>Deferment:</h4> 
A deferment is an approved pause in repaying a student loan.
					
<h4>Alternative Loans:</h4>
These private student loans from banks or other lending institutions are not federally supported or guaranteed. Students must be enrolled to apply for these loans.
					
<h4>National Merit Scholarship Program:</h4> 
Students who do well on the PSAT may qualify for scholarships. A few students receive full scholarships.
					
<h4>Estimated Financial Aid (EFA):</h4>
 This is the amount of financial aid a student will likely be eligible for. The figure is calculated based on all required financial aid forms.
					
<h4>Student Contribution:</h4> 
This is the amount a student is expected to contribute to his or her educational expenses.
					
<h4>Expected Family Contribution (EFC):</h4> 
To be eligible for federal financial aid, parents must fill out a FAFSA form with detailed financial information. The EFC is calculated based on this information, showing the amount of money the family can reasonably be expected to contribute to their child's education. There are free EFC calculators available online.
					
<h4>Federal Stafford Loan:</h4> 
These student financial aid loans are obtained through banks, lending institutions or colleges. To qualify, students must be enrolled in a college degree program at least part-time. The loans may be subsidized (need-based, typically for low-income students), or unsubsidized (not need-based so any student can apply). Students apply by filling out the FAFSA.
					
<h4>PLUS:</h4> 
Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students. These federal guaranteed loans are available for parents of undergraduates.
					
<h4>Master Promissory Note (MPN):</h4> 
This form promises repayment, and is signed by a student or parent when taking out a PLUS or Stafford Loan.
					
<h4>Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG):</h4> 
This federal government program provides need-based grants to low-income college students, and is administered through the school's financial aid office.
					
<h4>Independent Student:</h4> 
Independent students are self-supporting students who are not financially dependent on their parents.
					
<h4>Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP):</h4> 
This federally guaranteed student loan program allows students to obtain low-interest loans from private lending institutions even if the student has no income, collateral or credit history.
					
<h4>Parent Contribution:</h4> 
This is the amount of money parents are expected to be able to contribute to their child's education.
					
<h4>Pell Grant:</h4> 
This federal program provides need-based educational grants for low-income students. Because they are grants, they do not have to be repaid.
					
<h4>Adjusted Gross Income:</h4>
 Most financial aid forms require parents or students to state their taxable AGI based on income minus maximum allowable adjustments.
					
<h4>Federal Work-Study Program:</h4> 
A federally-funded, need-based program administered by each school, this program allows students to work on campus in exchange for a portion of their tuition.
					
<h4>Scholarships: </h4>
These funds are given to, or earned by, students, and are to be used for tuition. There are numerous public and private sources for scholarships. Some are given based on need, some on merit or skill. Others have very specific stipulations on who can receive the scholarship.
					
<h4>ROTC:</h4> 
Reserve Officers Training Corps. In this program, the military pays a student's tuition or other expenses. The student takes part in summer training while in college, and commits to military service after college.
					
<h4>Perkins Loan Program:</h4> 
This federally funded, need-based loan program provides low-interest loans to both undergraduate and graduate students.

<h6> Types of Colleges To Think About It</h6>
<br></br>

<ul  class="big" style="list-style-type:circle">
<br>
  <li>Safety Schools: These schools should be the ones where you are anywhere from 90-100% sure that you will get in. Your academic credentials should fall above the school's average for incoming freshmen. Applying to your safety schools should give you a calm reassurance. Most people apply to at least 2 safety schools.</li><br>
  <li>Meet Schools: These schools well...they match you. Your academic credentials are well within or may even exceed the school's range for incoming freshmen. There are no promises, but there is a strong chance that you may be accepted to a match school. Most students apply to 3 match schools.</li><br>
  <li>Reach Schools: These schools may not be in your reach...as the name states. Your academic credentials fall below the school's average for incoming freshmen. These schools are usually a long-shot, but they may be possible if you have impressive extra curriculum activities and leadership qualities.
  Be wise, these choices must also be realistic. If you have a 2.0, Harvard is not a reach school-that's a dream. Most people apply to 3 reach schools. </li><br>

<h1> INTERNSHIPS </h1>
<h2> <a href="https://www.nyhistory.org/education/internships/high-school-internships"> New York Historical Society High School Internship </a> </h2>
<p> Interested in a unique, hands-on experience at New York&rsquo;s oldest museum? The New-York Historical Society offers two sessions of the Student Historian Internship Program each year (Academic Year and Summer). The Student Historian High School Internship Program is designed for students in grades 10, 11, and 12 in the tri-state area. The Student Historian Program is a comprehensive internship and youth development program that provides students with vocational and academic training, public speaking and leadership skills, and an increased understanding of American art and history. Through object- and inquiry-based learning, students broaden their academic perspective, increase their confidence in professional settings, and enhance their knowledge of fulfilling careers in the museum world.</p>


<h2> <a href="https://www.dosomething.org/us/about/high-school-internships "> Do Something High School Internship </a> </h2>
<p> DoSomething, the country&rsquo;s largest non-profit specifically geared towards youth-driven social change, is a great opportunity no matter what field you want to pursue. Another great summer internship find, the Do Something High School Internship combines a &quot;super fun and positive work environment&quot; (dosomething.org) with stellar non-profit creds. It&rsquo;ll not only add to your resume, but also help you think more about giving back to the rest of the community and the world. Another plus: the Do Something team loves a good bake-off (interns versus full-time staff, of course). </p>

<h2> <a href="http://www.jkcp.com/program/internships-for-high-school-students.php 
"> Julian Krinsky Summer Internship </a> </h2>
<p> With a Julian Krinsky Summer Internship, students ages 16-18 will be placed in a professional office or business located in greater Philadelphia. Throughout the high school internship program, you&rsquo;ll have an inside advantage as you work in the industry of your choice, build a network of contacts and develop your resume for the future. Intern with a lawyer, develop marketing campaigns, shadow a doctor, assist a vet, or work with high-profile businesses. Plus, as a student in the Julian Krinsky Internship Program, you can earn college credit from the University of Delaware Alfred Lerner College of Business and Economics.</p>

<h2> <a href="http://www.feinsteininstitute.org/education-careers/education/student-intern-programs/ "> Feinstein Institute for Medical Research Student Intern Program </a></h2> 
<p> The Feinstein Institute Summer Intern program is designed to provide high school, college and graduate students with hands-on experience in disease-oriented research and familiarize them with opportunities that exist for careers in medical research. At the end of the internship, students will be expected to present an academic poster summarizing their research to faculty and other students. This program requires a full 8-week commitment. Students need to be at least 16 years of age. Students will need to choose either a laboratory-based research internship or a clinical research internship. </p>

<h2> <a href="http://www1.nyc.gov/site/dycd/services/jobs-internships/nyc-ladders-for-leaders.page 
">  NYC Ladders for Leaders </a> </h2>
<p> The NYC Ladders for Leaders program provides high school and college students the opportunity to participate in summer internships with some of the most dynamic corporations and businesses in New York City. The NYC Ladders for Leaders program, a component of the Summer Youth Employment Program (SYEP), provides professional internships to NYC youth between the ages of 16 to 21. This competitive process differs from the traditional SYEP model in that it requires applicants to submit an application to one of several community-based organizations (CBO) serving the five boroughs. Applications are evaluated based on academic performance, response to an essay question, and resume. Once participants have been selected, they are engaged in 30-hours of pre-employment training designed to teach essential workplace readiness skills and business etiquette. Interviews for summer internships are scheduled by our partnering CBO&rsquo;s in a variety of industries from the public and private sectors. Final selections for the six-week internship are made by our partnering employers.</p>
